## Mortus Blog

#### Objectives: 
 This web app is to have a personal blog that users can read my posts. Users can then comment on those posts. as a writer i can then 
 review the commnts and delete them as well as edit and delete my blog posts.
 
 
#### Roles:
This app will have three regula users:
1.  Admin
2.  Writer
3.  Reader

The site admin will have complete control of e other users posts and will be able to delete any posts. they will also be responsible for 
the creation of writer accounts.

The writer will be able to create blog posts and have control over the posts that they generate. They will be able to access the comments
 to delete them but only for their posts.
 
The reader will only be able to read blog posts and write comments on the posts. they have no control over the deletion of the comment. 
they will also be able to join a mailing list so as to recieve notifications of new posts.


#### Content plan:
The content will be in form of written blogs. The writer will write a blog post in plain text and some basic styling but will not be able
 to link images to the post at the outset. that is a feature that the design team will look into in future itertions of this app.
 
#### Project flow:
the user will get to the landing page and be able to see the latest post on the app. They will also be able to see the older ones the 
lower down they scroll. 
The user will then click on the blog post they wish to comment on and be redirected to the page with the post. they will then be able to 
comment.. they will also be able to subscribe to the blog if they want to via a link in the navbar which will take them to a form that 
collects their email address.
The writer has the option to login to the site and have a dashboard on their profile page. from there they will be able to create new 
blog posts and  edit any existing ones. they will also have the right to delete any comment on their blog posts.

#### Maintainance
The site will be maintained by the site admin: James.
